## About the Summit

The third Typelevel Summit will once again be co-located with the [Northeast Scala Symposium](http://www.nescala.org/) in New York City, with one day of recorded talks and one day of (shared) unconference.
The Summit will happen on March 23, NE Scala on March 24, and finally, the unconference on March 25.

The Summits are open to all, not just current contributors to and users of the Typelevel projects, and we are especially keen to encourage participation from people who are new to them.
Whilst many of the Typelevel projects use somewhat "advanced" Scala, they are a lot more approachable than many people think, and a major part of Typelevel's mission is to make the ideas they embody much more widely accessible.
If you're interested in types and pure functional programming we'd love to see you here!

This is a community conference and we strive to make it an inclusive and fulfilling event for all participants. All attendees, speakers, and organizers must abide by the [Typelevel Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html).

## Tickets

This year, we're offering a combined ticket for both NE Scala and the Summit.
We're trying very hard to keep the ticket price low, as this is – as always – not a for-profit venture.
Participation at the shared unconference will be free of charge.

**Tickets will go on sale January 19, 12pm EST.**

## Call for Speakers

The Summit will feature both 30 minute and 15 minute-long talks.

We are looking for a variety of things! Possible topic ranges include, but are not limited to:

  - Experience reports:  "How we migrated our code base to shapeless"
  - Typelevel project updates: "What's new in Typelevel project X"
  - Your project updates: "What's new in X", where X uses Typelevel heavily
  - Big picture: "Where is Scala headed for typed FP?"
  - Non-code issues: "Diversity in the Scala community", "Governance in Typelevel"
  - Tutorial-style: "Error-handling with cats", "Idiomatic ScalaCheck"
  - Tooling: "We can now use Ensime in Notepad"
  - Related work: "How language X does typed FP and what we could learn"

Proposals should be related to the Typelevel family in some way or follow the Typelevel spirit.

**We welcome all sorts of talks!** You don't have to write down a perfect abstract. **Submissions by first-time speakers are especially welcome!**

Submission closes January 23.
