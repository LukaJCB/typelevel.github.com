## About the Summit

The fourth Typelevel Summit will be co-located with **the** Scala conference: <a href="http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-cph-2017">Scala Days</a>!

The Summits are open to all, not just current contributors to and users of the Typelevel projects, and we are especially keen to encourage participation from people who are new to them.
Whilst many of the Typelevel projects use somewhat "advanced" Scala, they are a lot more approachable than many people think, and a major part of Typelevel's mission is to make the ideas they embody much more widely accessible.
If you're interested in types and pure functional programming we'd love to see you here!

This is a community conference and we strive to make it an inclusive and fulfilling event for all participants. All attendees, speakers, and organizers must abide by the [Typelevel Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html).

## Call for Speakers

The Summit will feature both 30 minute and 15 minute-long talks.

We are looking for a variety of things! Possible topic ranges include, but are not limited to:

  - Experience reports:  "How we migrated our code base to shapeless"
  - Typelevel project updates: "What's new in Typelevel project X"
  - Your project updates: "What's new in X", where X uses Typelevel heavily
  - Big picture: "Where is Scala headed for typed FP?"
  - Non-code issues: "Diversity in the Scala community", "Governance in Typelevel"
  - Tutorial-style: "Error-handling with cats", "Idiomatic ScalaCheck"
  - Tooling: "We can now use Ensime in Notepad"
  - Related work: "How language X does typed FP and what we could learn"

Proposals should be related to the Typelevel family in some way or follow the Typelevel spirit.

**We welcome all sorts of talks!** You don't have to write down a perfect abstract. **Submissions by first-time speakers are especially welcome!**
